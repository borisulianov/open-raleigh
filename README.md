Theme for Openbox - Window decoration that emules Win95 look.

So far I've reached a point where I need to investigate further into the depths
of OpenBox to fully achieve the real look of Windows 95.

Installation
------------

Simply compress the openbox-3 folder with tar.gz and rename the resulting file with an .obt extension.

Then run lxappearance, click on “Window Border” tab and select “Install a new theme”.

It's best with Raleigh or Redmond GTK-2 themes.
